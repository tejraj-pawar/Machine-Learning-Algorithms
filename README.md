# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
##### This repository contains notebooks describing how to use various machine learning algorithms for prediction.
##### here i have provided notebooks describing following ML algorithms:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regresion(Kaggle's Titanic Dataset)
* K-Nearest Neighbours
* Decision Tress and Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine
* K-Means Clustring

##### NOTE: I have also attached datasets(.csv) for each algorithm.
